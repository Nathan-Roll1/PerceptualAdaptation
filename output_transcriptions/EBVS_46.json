  "Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl",
  "like a flash he launched himself into the furthest mass of the world",
  "like a flash he launched himself into the furthest mass of the wall",
  "like a flash he launched himself into the furious mass of the war",
  "like a flash he launched himself into the furious mass of the world"
