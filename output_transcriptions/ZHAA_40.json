  "It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made",
  "it round all sound that brute agony and death may have made",
  "it wore not all sound that brute agony and death may have made",
  "it rent all sound that brute agony and death may have made",
  "it resounds all sound that brute agony and death may have made"
