  "For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap",
  "for the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap",
  "the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap",
  "but the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap",
  "the first time in his life he was yelling for a scrap"
