  "Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl",
  "like a flash he launched himself into the fiery mass of the orb",
  "like a flash he launched himself into the fiery mass of the oil",
  "like a flash he launched himself into the fiery mass of the ocean",
  "like a flash he launched himself into the fiery mass of the oar"
