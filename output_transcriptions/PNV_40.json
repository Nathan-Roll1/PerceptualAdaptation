  "It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made",
  "it drowned all sound that brute agony and death might have made",
  "it dwelt on the thought that brute agony and death might have made",
  "it dwelt on the sound that brute agony and death might have made",
  "a drought all the sound that brute agony and death might have made"
