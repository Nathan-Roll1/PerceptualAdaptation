  "Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl",
  "like flesh he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl",
  "like flesh he lunged himself into the feathered mass of the owl",
  "like flesh he lodged himself into the feathered mass of the owl",
  "like flesh he launched himself into the feathery mass of the owl"
