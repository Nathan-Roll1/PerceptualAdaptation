  "It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made",
  "it drew all sound that brute agony and death may have made",
  "it drew all sorrow that brute agony and death may have made",
  "it drew all song that brute agony and death may have made",
  "it drew all sound that broke agony and death may have made"
